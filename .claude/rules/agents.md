# Agent Delegation Rules

See `rules/workflow-routing.md` for three-tier routing: fast path / full workflow / orchestrator.

## Agent Registry
- **agent-orchestrator**: Multi-domain + trust-boundary coordination. NOT the default — earned by multi-domain + trust boundary.
- **tech-lead-subagent**: Architecture decisions, API contracts, implementation coordination
- **security-engineer-subagent**: Threat modeling, security rules. BEFORE implementation for: new auth flows, payment processing, PII handling, new external API exposure. Skip for: internal utilities, UI changes, non-security config updates, existing API field additions that do NOT change the security posture (no new PII field, no auth semantics change). **Do not skip** for changes matching `rules/workflow-routing.md` trust-boundary item 6 (TLS, JWT keys, IAM, encryption, secret-handling paths) — those are trust-boundary config changes and Security is required. When `workflow-routing.md` and this skip list appear to disagree, `workflow-routing.md` wins.
- **business-analyst-subagent**: Requirements clarification, prioritization, MVP scoping
- **backend-engineer-subagent**: APIs, business logic, databases
- **frontend-engineer-subagent**: UI components, user experience
- **devops-engineer-subagent**: CI/CD, infrastructure, containers
- **data-engineer-subagent**: ETL, data pipelines, warehouses
- **ai-engineer-subagent**: LLM integration, prompt engineering, RAG, agent design, AI cost optimization
- **mobile-engineer-subagent**: Flutter/Dart, iOS (Swift/SwiftUI), Android (Kotlin/Compose), React Native
- **aws-infrastructure-subagent**: AWS CDK, Lambda, Step Functions, DynamoDB, SQS, API Gateway, EventBridge
- **ui-ux-designer-subagent**: Wireframes, component specs, user flow design — activate before frontend when visual design needed
- **api-test-agent**: Performance, security smoke, endpoint smoke, stress testing against running services
- **qa-subagent**: Final validation gate. AFTER implementation. Optional for single-file fixes and trivial changes.
- **code-reviewer**: Reviews completed work against plan and standards. Read-only tools (no Write/Edit). In orchestrator paths (where TechLead is contract-mode and does not run reviews), the orchestrator MUST dispatch code-reviewer after implementation when a structured review is needed — no other agent owns this gate.
- **codebase-mapper**: Read-only exploration agent spawned by `/map-codebase` to write `.planning/codebase/` documents. Returns confirmation only (~10 lines), never document contents. Not part of trust-boundary or orchestrator flows.

Per-dispatch model selection (override the agent's default `model:` frontmatter): see `references/model-routing.md`.

## Dispatch Contract
- Every `Task` dispatch by a delegating agent (orchestrator, tech-lead full-mode, BA-standalone) MUST follow `rules/dispatch-prompt-contract.md` — XML-tagged prompt with role, context, inputs, task, exit_criteria, out_of_scope, evidence, bailout, return_format.
- Every subagent's return MUST include three things (prose, markdown, or XML — shape is flexible): status ∈ {DONE, DONE_WITH_CONCERNS, NEEDS_CONTEXT, BLOCKED}, evidence paths the dispatcher can `Read`, and an exit-criteria check. Full conventions: `rules/subagent-return-format.md`.
- Dispatchers verify every cited evidence path and confirm each exit criterion is marked met before accepting `DONE`.
- Fast-path work does not dispatch subagents, so no exemption clause is needed.

## Quality Gates
- Never skip quality gates for trust-boundary changes (auth, payments, PII, external API) or multi-domain changes
- Fast-path changes (no trust boundary) do not require QA — TDD + verification is sufficient
- QA can run parallel with API Test agent

## Factual Grounding
- All agents MUST follow `rules/reduce-hallucinations.md` — no invented file paths, function names, flags, APIs, or commit SHAs. Cite the source or say "I don't know".
- Dispatchers: treat fabricated evidence paths in subagent returns as BLOCKED, per `rules/subagent-return-format.md`.

## Planning Skills Ordering

Three skills cover plan/execution and can be confused. Use this order:

1. **`writing-plans`** — produces the plan document. Invoke once, at the start of a full-workflow or orchestrator task, after brainstorming and before any Task dispatch. Outputs a written plan that downstream skills consume.
2. **`subagent-driven-development`** — executes the plan **within the current session** by dispatching leaf subagents for independent tasks. Use when the plan has parallelizable leaf work and the dispatcher is the main session (or orchestrator). Also use for single-session + checkpoints by pausing between tasks to confirm with the user.
3. **`executing-plans`** — executes the plan **in a separate session with review checkpoints**. Use when the plan spans multiple review gates, or when the user wants human-in-the-loop checkpoints between phases that must survive a context reset.

Decision: single-session + many leaves → `subagent-driven-development` (with or without intra-session checkpoints). Multi-session + checkpoints → `executing-plans`. Both skills assume a `writing-plans` output exists; do not start execution without a plan document for full-workflow / orchestrator paths.

**Plan vs. TechLead contract:** when TechLead (contract-mode) produces a contract/ADR as part of orchestrator or full-workflow, the `writing-plans` output is the execution plan (task breakdown, ordering, parallelism) and the TechLead output is the design artifact (API shape, data model). They are complementary, not duplicative. Write the plan AFTER TechLead's contract exists so tasks can reference concrete contract paths.

Fast-path work skips all three.
